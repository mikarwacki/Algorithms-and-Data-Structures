# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

Repository contains implementations of Java Data Structures such as:
- LinkedList,
- HashMap,
- Queue,
- Stack.
As well as pattern matching algorithms and Binary Trees, Graphs with basic search algorithms.

Sorting algorithms are implemented in different files depending on their time complexity. 

List 2 - OneWay LinkedList,
List 3 - TwoWay LinkedList,
List 4 - Queue and Stack,
List 5 - Sorting algorithms O(n<sup>2</sup>),
List 6 - Sorting algorithms O(n*log(n)),
List 7 - Hashmap,
List 8 - Binary Search Tree,
List 9 - Disjoint Sets,
List 10 - Graph dfs and bfs,
List 11 - Weighted Graph calculate shortest path from given Start Node,
List 12 - Pattern matching algorithms,
List 13 - Convex Hull.
